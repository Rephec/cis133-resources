I chose this resource because its coming in the form of a video where they explain step by step on how to use HTML & CSS while showing me as it goes. I prefer video in this case because I like being able to hear them explain what to do while at the same time showing step by step on how to do it. If I get stuck i can always rewind a little and see how they something.

I chose this because it had other links for specific topics if i need to just drop into something real quick. I dug into 4 of the resources provided in this one and looked into the tutorial and liked somewhat. I do however preffered my first pick more just for its easy step by step process and how it has a playlist on this topic.
